(1)What is jquery?
Ans:--jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
      The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
      jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
      jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
    
    --> The jQuery library contains the following features:
          1.HTML/DOM manipulation
          2.CSS manipulation
          3.HTML event methods
          4.Effects and animations
          5.AJAX
          6.Utilities

(4)Event bubbling tickling example
Ans:--Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
